This is an open source library for talking to the Ocean Optics USB2000 (note that Ocean Optics has since re-branded as Ocean Insight).

This library has been unmaintained since 2005 and was barely accessible via a [sourceforge CVS server](https://sourceforge.net/projects/oousb2k/) with an invalid SSL certificate so I decided to make a copy here. I am not the original author and have contributed no code to this repo.

The original readme file is in `README.orig`.
